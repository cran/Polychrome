Polychrome v0.9.3 (Release Date: 2017-06-06)
==============

Changes:

* Changed 'computeDistances' so it now only returns the vector of
  minimal relative distances, in order to improve usability.

Polychrome v0.9.0 (Release Date: 2017-04-28)
==============

Changes: 

* Added a second vignettte, focused on creating palettes.

* Removed the 'turnGray' function, since it duplicates functionality
  from colorspace::desaturate.

* Added error checking to the arguments of most of the functions.

* Changed 'swatch' so it uses the luminance to decide whether to write
  color labels in white or black.

* Changed the 'computeDistances' function so it includes the default
  starting point, thus obviating the need for adding one when you
  count the number of separated colors. (Technically, the distance
  for  the first point should be infinite, but we set it to the
  distance to the second point to make it easier to plot.)

* Changed the 'plotDistances' function so it now colors the points.

Non-Visible Changes

* Added test code for converting different kinds of color
  specifications into hex-strings.
